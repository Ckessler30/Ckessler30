### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a highly organized and driven software developer who strives to exceed all expectations. I have experience building out dynamic full stack web applications using JavaScript, Python, React/Redux, HTML/CSS, and SQL. I have proven the ability to analyze and solve problems in difficult situations while maintaining a positive attitude. I thrive in team environments where I can contribute individually as well as act as a strong leader/teammate in the overall success of the project.

My passion for programming is backed by the fact that there is always more to learn and I am excited to do so.
